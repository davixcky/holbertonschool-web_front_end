# 0x00. Advanced HTML
## Concepts
For this project, students are expected to look at this **concept:**
[HTML - elements of a web page](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/139)

## Welcome!
Welcome to the Web Stack specialization. The 3 first projects will give you all basics of the Web development: HTML, CSS and Developer tools.

In this project, you will learn how to use HTML tags to structure a web page. No CSS, no styling - don’t worry, the final page will be “ugly” it’s normal, it’s not the purpose of this project.

Important note: details are important! lowercase vs uppercase / wrong letter… be careful!
